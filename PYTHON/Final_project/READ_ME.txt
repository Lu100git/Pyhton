the following project was the final project from the website:
https://academy.zenva.com

the difference with this script is that since i was on a linux enviroment 

i couldn't use the python 3 features

so i had to improvise and write the code differently 

this is why i couldn't do heritance on the clases

since it's a python 3 feature, 

thus the explanation of why the code is longer.

but in the end of the day, everythig runs good
